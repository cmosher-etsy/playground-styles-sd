Testing out functionality provided by Style Dictionary.

The goal is to convert token JSON into outputs that will work in demo apps.

Web (scss w/ CSS vars), Android (compose), iOS (Color assets and Swift objext), and Flutter.

Will want to be able to pack/publish as well. This should package Web for NPM, Android for Maven, and iOS for SPM.
